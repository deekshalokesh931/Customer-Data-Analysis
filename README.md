# Customer-Data-Analysis

Conclusion of the Analysis: 

1) Approximately 2.70% of customers have registered but not made any purchases, with missing values indicating zero profit and promotions. Moreover, 36.86% have made only their first purchase, suggesting a potential focus on gathering feedback and addressing possible negative experiences. Additionally, 32.19% of customers who made purchases did not redeem any promotions, prompting a need to investigate the reasons behind non-redemption.

2) The majority of customers fall within the age range of 19 to 38 years, with a peak around 25-28 years. The gender distribution indicates that a significant proportion of customers are labelled as "male."

3) Registration activity is most active during two key time periods: around noon (from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM) and in the evening (from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM). Customers aged 20 to 40 exhibit notably higher levels of engagement compared to other age groups.

4) The "direct" and "organic search" sources are significant contributors to profit, and they are also associated with notable losses. These sources are stable, but they need improvement. "Paid Search," "Affiliates," and "Paid Social" sources require attention as they have a notable impact on both profit and loss.

5) Customers who allowed contact provided approximately 66.4% of the total profit, while customers who did not allow contact contributed 33.6% of the total profit. This information can be used for targeted marketing strategies.

6) Most customers are concentrated in major cities like Dublin, which has the highest net profit. However, there are many other cities that neither provide profit nor loss, indicating potential for growth or in the edge of contributig to loss.

7) The analysis of monthly profit trends shows an increasing trend in both profit and net profit as the months progress, with March being the most active month.

    The analysis suggests that the business is doing reasonably well but could benefit from improving sources like "Paid Search," "Affiliates," and "Paid Social." Focusing on age groups, time of registration, and customer contact preferences can aid in optimising marketing efforts. Additionally, exploring the potential of cities with neither profit nor loss can lead to new opportunities for growth. Overall, a data-driven approach can help the retailer make informed decisions and further enhance its performance.
